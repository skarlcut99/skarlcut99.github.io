Hi I'm Sukhveer Karlcut, a Master's student at UCSC. I am interested in machine learning and AI. 
A couple projects I have worked on are emulating chip design and optimizing memory and performance for this software, machine learning model conversion to TensorRT
for faster and more accurate image segmentation, and implementing an auto-labeling software for auditing machine learning datasets.
A few hobbies I have are playing soccer, listening to music, and playingg video games.
My personal email is skarlcut@gmail.com.
